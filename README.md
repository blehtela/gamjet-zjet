# gamjet-zjet
This is my code for the photon+jet cross section measurement, Z+jet cross section measurement and the ratio analysis of these two measurements.

## Structure of this project 
This repository contains the following directories for described purposes:
- **data**: contains some testing data, in the beginning using some 2023D data
- **CondFormats/JetMETObjects**: analogously to dijet analysis, this is the dir containing JEC (amongst other things)
- **photonjet**: contains the analysis code for the photon+jet cross section measurement
- **zjet**: contains the analysis code for the Z+jet cross section measurement
